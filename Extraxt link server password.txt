This powershell function, written by NetSPI's Antti Rantasaari, allows you to retrieve SQL login credentials stored in linked server logins.

You need:

    to be at the console of the SQL Server;
    DAC connectivity to local SQL instances;
    local admin privileges (needed to access registry key)
    sysadmin privileges to SQL instances

To run it:

    Download and save the .ps1 script file;
    open a cmd window (with admin privileges);
    cd to the folder containing the script file; 




powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -command "& { . .\decrypt.ps1; Get-MSSQLLinkPasswords }"
